msgid "PostGIS supports another kind of spatial data type called a *raster*. Raster data, much like geometry data, uses **Cartesian coordinates** and a spatial reference system. However instead of vector data, raster data is represented as an n-dimensional matrix consisting of pixels and bands. The bands defines the number of matrices you have. Each pixel stores a value corresponding to each band. So a 3-banded raster such as an RGB image, would have 3 values for each pixel corresponding to the Red-Green-Blue bands."

msgid "Although pretty pictures such as those you see on your TV screen are rasters, rasters may not be that exciting to look at. In a nutshell, a raster is a matrix, pinned on a coordinate system, that has values that can represent anything you want them to represent."

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:15
msgid "Since rasters live in cartesian space, rasters can interact with geometries.  PostGIS offers many functions that take as input both rasters and geometries. Also many operations applied to rasters will result in geometries. Common ones are the `ST_Polygon`, `ST_Envelope`, `ST_ConvexHull`, and `ST_MinConvexHull` as shown below."

msgid "The above example CREATEs a table (**rasters**) from geometries formed from letters using the PostGIS 3.2+ `ST_Letters <https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Letters.html>`_ function. Rasters similar to geometries, can take advantage of spatial indexes. The spatial index used for raster is a functional index that indexes the geometry envelope (or convexhull) of the raster."

msgid "Although pgAdmin and psql have no mechanism yet to view postgis rasters, we have a couple of options. For smallish rasters the easiest is to output to a web-friendly raster format such as PNG using batteries included postgis raster functions like `ST_AsPNG` or `ST_AsGDALRaster` listed in `PostGIS Raster output functions <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_reference.html#Raster_Outputs>`_. As your rasters get larger, you'll want to graduate to a tool such as QGIS to view them in all their glory or the GDAL family of commandline tools such as gdal_translate to export them to other raster formats.  Remember though, postgis rasters are built for analysis, not for generating pretty pictures for you to look at."

msgid "The `ST_AsRaster` has many overloaded representations. The earlier example used the simplest such implementation and accepted the default arguments which are 8BUI and 1 band, with no data being 0. If you need to use the other variants, you should use the named arguments call syntax so that you don't accidentally fall into the wrong variant of the function or get *function is not unique* errors."

msgid "The postgis_raster extension has over 100 functions to choose from.  We'll focus on the ones you will commonly use. PostGIS raster functionality was patterned after the PostGIS geometry support.  As such you'll find an overlap of functions between raster and geometry where it makes sense. Common ones you'll use are :command:`ST_Intersects`, :command:`ST_Union`, :command:`ST_Intersection`, and :command:`ST_Transform`. In addition to those overlapping functions, it offers many functions that work in conjunction with geometry or are very specific to rasters."

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:189
msgid "The `ST_Union <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Union.html>`_ function for raster, just as the geometry equivalent :command:`ST_Union`, aggregates a set of rasters together into a single raster.  However, just as with geometry, not all rasters can be combined together, but the rules for raster unioning are more complicated than geometry rules. In the case of geometries, all you need is to have the same spatial reference system, but for rasters that is not sufficient."

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:211
msgid "In order for rasters to be combined, they need to be on the same grid so to speak. Meaning they must have same pixel sizes, same orientation (the skew), same spatial reference system, and their pixels must not cut into each other, meaning they share the same worldly pixel grid."

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:221
msgid "We can fix this by shifting the upper left y coordinates ever so slightly and then trying again. If our grids start at integer level since our pixel sizes are whole integer, then the pixels won't cut into each other."

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:240
msgid "If ever you are unclear why your rasters don't have the same alignment, you can use the function `ST_SameAlignment <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_SameAlignment.html>`_, which will compare 2 rasters or a set of rasters and tell you if they have the same alignment.  If you have notices enabled, the NOTICE will tell you what is off with the rasters in question. The `ST_NotSameAlignmentReason <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_NotSameAlignmentReason.html>`_, instead of just a notice will output the reason. It however only works with two rasters at a time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:247
msgid "One major way in which the `ST_Union <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Union.html>`_ raster function deviates from the `ST_Union <https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Union.html>`_ geometry function is that it allows for an argument called *uniontype*.  This argument by default is set to `LAST` if you don't specify it, which means, take the **LAST** raster pixel values in occasions where the rasters overlap."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:252
msgid "But on occassion, **LAST** may not be the right operation. Let's suppose our rasters represented two different sets of observations from two different devices. These devices measure the same, thing, and we aren't sure which is right when they cross paths, so we'd instead like to take the `MEAN` of the results.  We'd do this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:268
msgid "So instead of **Raster** trumping **Hello**, we'd see a blending of the two forces. Note that for geometries since geometries are vector and thus have no values besides there or not there, there really isn't any ambiguity on how to combine two vectors when they intersect."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:273
msgid "Another feature of the raster :command:`ST_Union` we glossed over, is this idea of if you should return all bands or just some bands. When you don't specify what bands to union, :command:`ST_Union` will combine same banded numbers and use the :command:`LAST` unioning strategy.  If you have multiple bands, this may not be what you want to do. Perhaps you only want to union, the second band. In this case, the Green Band and you want the count of pixel values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:287
msgid "Note in the case of the **COUNT** union type, which counts the number of pixels filled in and returns that value, The result is always a **32BUI** similar to how when you do a :command:`COUNT` in sql, the result is always a bigint, to accommodate large counts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:291
msgid "In other cases, the band pixel type does not change and is set to the max value or rounded if the amounts exceed the bounds of the type. Why would anyone ever want to count pixels that intersect at a location. Well suppose each of your rasters represent police squadrons and incidents of arrests in the areas. Each value, might represent a different kind of arrest reason. You are doing stats on how many arrests in each region, therefore you only care about the count of arrests."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:300
msgid "Or perhaps, you want to do all bands, but you want different strategies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:310
msgid "Using the *unionarg[]* variant of the :command:`ST_Union` function, also allows you to shuffle the order of the bands."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:313
msgid "Clipping Rasters"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:314
msgid "The `ST_Clip <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Clip.html>`_ function is one of the most widely used functions for PostGIS rasters.  The main reason is the more pixels you need to inspect or do operations on, the slower your processing. **ST_Clip** clips your raster to just the area of interest, so you can isolate your operations to just that area."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:318
msgid "This function is also special in that it utilizes the power of geometry to help raster analysis. To reduce the number of pixels, :command:`ST_Union` has to handle, each raster is clipped first to the area we are interested in."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/rasters.rst:330
msgid "This example showcases several functions working in unison.  The :command:`ST_Intersects` function employed is the one packaged with **postgis_raster** and can intersect 2 rasters or a raster and a geometry. Similar to the geometry :command:`ST_Intersects` the raster :command:`ST_Intersects` can take advantage of spatial indexes on the raster or geometry tables."
